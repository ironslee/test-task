# Test task, product table

The project is built using React, Redux, Axios, and TypeScript, with Vite for build management and Ant Design for the UI.

It includes a login form, a main page displaying a table, and a modal form for creating/editing entries. The table supports sorting in both ascending and descending orders, with the default sort applied to the name field in descending order. Pagination is implemented, allowing the number of displayed items to vary between 10 and 100 per page. Search functionality is available for the name and code fields.
